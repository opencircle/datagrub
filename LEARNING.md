# Learnings from AI-Driven Conversation Analysis in Wealth Management

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
**Purpose:** External Confluence Documentation

---

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes key learnings from implementing AI-driven conversation analysis for wealth management advisor-client interactions. We leverage three foundational methodologies:

1. **Dynamic Temperature Adjustment (DTA)** for context-aware transcript summarization across information gathering, recommendation, and financial planning stages
2. **Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR)** for reliable conversation quality scoring from both advisor coaching and client experience perspectives
3. **Evaluation-driven SDLC** with CI/CD quality gates for continuous prompt refinement and reliability

Our implementation demonstrates that combining adaptive generation strategies (DTA) with validated scoring frameworks (SSR) enables scalable, reliable analysis of advisor-client conversations while maintaining development velocity through automated evaluation pipelines.

## 1. Dynamic Temperature Adjustment for Wealth Management Conversations

### 1.1 Overview of DTA Methodology

**Citation:** Chen et al. (2024). "Entropy-based Dynamic Temperature (EDT) Sampling for Large Language Model Text Generation." arXiv:2403.14541v1.

Dynamic Temperature Adjustment addresses a fundamental challenge in LLM-based text generation: **a fixed temperature parameter cannot adequately meet varying generation requirements** across different conversation contexts and stages.

#### Core Mechanism

The EDT approach dynamically adjusts the temperature parameter at each token generation step based on the model's confidence, measured through entropy:

```
T = T₀ × (N^(θ/Entropy))
```

Where:
- **T₀** = Baseline temperature (typically 0.7-1.0)
- **θ** = Tuning hyperparameter controlling sensitivity
- **N** = Scaling factor (0.8 in original experiments)
- **Entropy** = Shannon entropy of token probability distribution

**Key Insight:** When the model is confident (low entropy), temperature decreases to favor high-probability tokens. When uncertain (high entropy), temperature increases to explore more diverse possibilities.

### 1.2 Three-Stage Application to Wealth Management

In wealth management advisor-client conversations, we identify three distinct processing stages, each benefiting from different generation characteristics:

#### Stage 1: Information Gathering & Fact Extraction

**Context:** Initial discovery phase where advisors collect client financial data, goals, risk tolerance, and current portfolio information.

**DTA Application:**
- **Low Temperature Preference (0.3-0.5):** Factual extraction requires precision
- **Objective:** Extract specific data points (account balances, investment timelines, risk scores)
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Allow higher temperature when interpreting ambiguous client statements about goals

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Fact extraction with conservative baseline
fact_extraction_config = {
    "base_temperature": 0.4,
    "theta": 0.6,
    "task_type": "extraction",
    "expected_output": "structured_data"
}

# Sample prompt
prompt = """
Extract factual information from this advisor-client conversation:
- Client age and retirement timeline
- Current portfolio value
- Risk tolerance (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
- Specific financial goals
- Tax situation

Conversation: [transcript]
"""
```

#### Stage 2: Insights Generation & Analysis

**Context:** Analytical phase where the system identifies patterns, risks, opportunities, and advisor recommendations.

**DTA Application:**
- **Medium Temperature Preference (0.7-0.9):** Balance creativity with accuracy
- **Objective:** Generate nuanced insights about client behavior, advisor approach quality, compliance issues
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Higher temperature for identifying novel patterns, lower for regulatory concerns

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Insights with balanced exploration
insights_config = {
    "base_temperature": 0.8,
    "theta": 0.8,
    "task_type": "analysis",
    "expected_output": "insights_list"
}

# Sample prompt
prompt = """
Analyze this wealth management conversation for:
1. Client engagement level and concerns
2. Advisor's needs discovery effectiveness
3. Risk assessment quality
4. Suitability and compliance considerations
5. Opportunities for deeper relationship building

Apply dynamic temperature to balance factual compliance analysis
with creative insight generation.

Conversation: [transcript]
"""
```

#### Stage 3: Summarization & Recommendation Synthesis

**Context:** Final phase producing executive summaries for CRM, compliance review, and advisor coaching.

**DTA Application:**
- **Adaptive Temperature (0.5-0.8):** Context-dependent based on summary type
- **Objective:** Generate coherent, accurate summaries that capture key decisions and action items
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Lower temperature for compliance summaries, higher for coaching recommendations

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Multi-audience summarization
summary_config = {
    "base_temperature": 0.6,
    "theta": 0.7,
    "task_type": "summarization",
    "audiences": ["compliance", "coaching", "crm"]
}

# Sample prompt structure
prompt = """
Generate three summaries from this financial planning conversation:

1. COMPLIANCE SUMMARY (temperature bias: low)
   - Suitability documentation
   - Disclosures made
   - Regulatory requirements met

2. CRM ACTION ITEMS (temperature bias: low)
   - Next steps committed
   - Follow-up timeline
   - Documents to prepare

3. COACHING INSIGHTS (temperature bias: medium-high)
   - Advisor strengths demonstrated
   - Improvement opportunities
   - Client relationship depth

Apply EDT to optimize each summary type independently.

Conversation: [transcript]
"""
```

### 1.3 Empirical Benefits in Wealth Management Context

**From Chen et al. (2024):**
- **~50% GPU memory reduction** vs. parallel model approaches
- **Significant quality improvements** across summarization benchmarks
- **Task-agnostic** applicability without retraining

**Wealth Management Specific Benefits:**

1. **Regulatory Precision:** Low-temperature fact extraction minimizes hallucination in compliance-critical areas
2. **Insight Quality:** Adaptive temperature enables nuanced analysis while maintaining factual grounding
3. **Cost Efficiency:** Single-model approach with memory reduction enables processing high conversation volumes
4. **Consistency:** Entropy-based adjustment provides deterministic behavior across similar conversation patterns

### 1.5 Implementation Recommendations

**Best Practices for Wealth Management DTA:**

1. **Baseline Temperature Tuning:**
   - Compliance/Fact Extraction: T₀ = 0.3-0.4
   - Insights/Analysis: T₀ = 0.7-0.9
   - Summarization: T₀ = 0.5-0.7

2. **Hyperparameter Configuration:**
   - Start with θ = 0.7, N = 0.8 per original research
   - A/B test against fixed temperature baselines
   - Monitor entropy distributions across conversation types

3. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Validate fact extraction against CRM ground truth
   - Human review of compliance summaries (initially 100%, then sampled)
   - Track hallucination rates per stage

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Log entropy distributions per conversation segment
   - Track effective temperature ranges by stage
   - Alert on anomalous entropy patterns (may indicate poor transcription quality)

## 2. Conversation Quality Scoring with Semantic Similarity Rating

### 2.1 The Challenge of LLM-Based Scoring

**Citation:** Ding et al. (2024). "Semantic Similarity Rating for LLM-Based Consumer Survey Responses." arXiv:2510.08338.

Traditional approaches to LLM-based conversation scoring face critical reliability issues:

1. **Direct Numerical Rating Instability:** Asking LLMs to output scores (1-10) directly produces inconsistent results
2. **Lack of Reasoning Transparency:** Direct scores don't provide qualitative justification
3. **Poor Test-Retest Reliability:** Same conversation evaluated twice yields different scores

**Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR) Solution:**

SSR addresses these challenges by:
1. **Eliciting textual explanations** from LLMs describing conversation quality
2. **Mapping text to numerical ratings** via embedding similarity to reference statements
3. **Providing both quantitative scores and qualitative feedback**

### 2.2 SSR Methodology Overview

**Empirical Validation (Ding et al., 2024):**
- Achieved **90% of human test-retest reliability**
- Maintained **realistic response distributions** (Kolmogorov-Smirnov similarity > 0.85)
- Tested on **57 personal care product surveys** with 9,300 human responses

**Three-Step Process:**

1. **Text Elicitation:** LLM generates detailed text describing quality aspects
2. **Embedding Generation:** Convert text to semantic vector representation
3. **Similarity Matching:** Calculate cosine similarity to pre-defined reference statements mapped to ratings

### 2.3 Dual-Perspective Application: Advisor Coaching & Client Experience

In wealth management, we evaluate conversations from **two distinct perspectives**:

#### Perspective A: Advisor Performance (Coaching Quality)

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
1. Needs discovery effectiveness
2. Active listening and empathy
3. Product knowledge and explanations
4. Compliance and suitability
5. Objection handling
6. Relationship building

#### Perspective B: Client Experience Quality

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
1. Client engagement level
2. Question asking behavior
3. Comfort with advisor recommendations
4. Understanding of proposed solutions
5. Commitment to next steps
6. Overall satisfaction signals

### 2.4 Sample Rating Scale Design (1-10 Likert)

**Scale Structure:**

| Rating | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Poor | Significant deficiencies, may pose compliance risk or client dissatisfaction |
| 3-4 | Below Average | Noticeable gaps in technique or engagement, improvement needed |
| 5-6 | Average | Meets basic standards, room for enhancement |
| 7-8 | Good | Demonstrates strong skills, minor optimization opportunities |
| 9-10 | Excellent | Exemplary performance, best-practice demonstration |

### 2.5 Reference Statement Framework

**For Advisor Coaching Perspective:**

#### Rating 1-2 (Poor) - Reference Statements
```
"The advisor dominated the conversation without asking about the client's goals or concerns."
"No discovery questions were asked; the advisor immediately pitched products."
"The advisor failed to address the client's stated risk concerns."
"Compliance red flags: unsuitable recommendations, inadequate disclosures."
```

#### Rating 3-4 (Below Average) - Reference Statements
```
"The advisor asked some discovery questions but didn't probe deeper into client goals."
"Product explanations were technical and confusing to the client."
"The advisor interrupted the client multiple times when they tried to express concerns."
"Suitability documentation was incomplete or rushed."
```

#### Rating 5-6 (Average) - Reference Statements
```
"The advisor followed a standard discovery process and documented key client information."
"Product recommendations were generally suitable but lacked personalization."
"The advisor addressed client questions adequately but didn't proactively anticipate concerns."

"Discovery uncovered non-obvious client goals and family dynamics affecting planning."
"The advisor educated the client using clear analogies that deepened understanding."
"Recommendations were highly personalized with creative solutions demonstrating expertise."
"The client expressed strong confidence and enthusiasm about working with this advisor."
```

**For Client Experience Perspective:**

#### Rating 1-2 (Poor) - Reference Statements
```
"The client was disengaged, providing minimal responses and showing signs of discomfort."
"The client expressed confusion multiple times but the concerns were not addressed."
"The client pushed back on recommendations and did not commit to next steps."
```

#### Rating 5-6 (Average) - Reference Statements
```
"The client participated appropriately, answering questions and asking some clarifying questions."
"The client seemed to understand the basic recommendations but didn't express strong enthusiasm."
"The client agreed to next steps in a neutral, procedural manner."
```

#### Rating 9-10 (Excellent) - Reference Statements
```
"The client was highly engaged, asking thoughtful questions and sharing personal context."
"The client expressed strong understanding and appreciation for the advisor's recommendations."
"The client demonstrated trust by sharing sensitive financial and family information."
"The client proactively committed to action items and expressed excitement about the plan."
```

### 2.6 Implementation Guide: SSR for Conversation Scoring

### 2.8 Validation and Quality Assurance

**Recommended Validation Process:**

1. **Human Baseline Creation:**
   - Have 3-5 expert coaches rate 100 sample conversations
   - Calculate inter-rater reliability (target: Krippendorff's α > 0.7)
   - Use consensus ratings as ground truth

2. **SSR Calibration:**
   - Run SSR on same 100 conversations
   - Measure correlation with human ratings (target: r > 0.75)
   - Analyze discrepancies and refine reference statements

3. **Test-Retest Reliability:**
   - Score same conversations multiple times
   - Measure consistency (target: > 90% per Ding et al.)
   - Monitor variance across conversation types

4. **Production Monitoring:**
   - Track confidence scores distribution
   - Alert on low-confidence evaluations (< 0.6)
   - Random sampling for human validation (10% of scores)
   - Quarterly recalibration against new human ratings

### 2.9 Key Advantages of SSR Approach

1. **Transparency:** Provides qualitative reasoning alongside quantitative scores
2. **Reliability:** 90% test-retest reliability vs. inconsistent direct scoring
3. **Actionability:** Dimension-specific feedback guides targeted coaching
4. **Scalability:** Automated scoring enables 100% conversation coverage
5. **Dual Perspective:** Captures both advisor performance and client experience
6. **Validation:** Embedding similarity provides confidence metrics

## 3. SDLC Integration: Evaluation-Driven Prompt Refinement

### 3.1 The Challenge of Prompt Engineering at Scale

Modern LLM applications require:
- **Continuous improvement** as models evolve and use cases expand
- **Regression prevention** when updating prompts
- **Quality assurance** before production deployment
- **Systematic testing** across edge cases and adversarial inputs

Traditional manual testing is insufficient for production-grade prompt engineering.

### 3.2 Evaluation Framework Options

Based on the datagrub project context, five evaluation library options are available:

1. **OpenAI Evals** - Standardized evaluation framework from OpenAI
2. **LangChain Evaluators** - Built-in evaluation tools with LangSmith integration
3. **PromptFoo** - Open-source LLM testing framework with CLI and CI/CD support
4. **DeepEval** - Python library for LLM evaluation with custom metrics
5. **TruLens** - Feedback-driven evaluation with production monitoring

**Recommended Choice for Wealth Management:** **PromptFoo** or **LangSmith**

**Rationale:**
- PromptFoo: Best CLI/CI integration, declarative config, multi-provider support
- LangSmith: Best for LangChain-based apps, production tracing, dataset management

### 3.3 Evaluation Types and Metrics

#### 3.3.1 Golden Dataset Tests

**Purpose:** Validate core functionality on known-good examples

**Example Golden Test Set:**
```yaml
# golden-tests.yaml
description: "Core conversation analysis golden dataset"

prompts:
  - file://prompts/fact_extraction.txt
  - file://prompts/insights_generation.txt
  - file://prompts/compliance_summary.txt

providers:
  - anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

tests:
  - description: "Extract client age and retirement timeline"
    vars:
      transcript: "Client: I'm 52 and looking to retire at 65..."
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: "age: 52"
      - type: contains
        value: "retirement: 65"
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Accurately extracted age and retirement timeline"

  - description: "Identify risk tolerance correctly"
    vars:
      transcript: "Client: I can't afford to lose money, I'm very conservative..."
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: "conservative"
      - type: not-contains
        value: "aggressive"
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Correctly classified risk tolerance as conservative"
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** % of assertions passed
- **Consistency:** Same output for identical inputs
- **Latency:** Response time per evaluation

#### 3.3.2 Edge Case Tests

**Purpose:** Validate behavior on boundary conditions and unusual inputs

**Example Edge Cases:**
```yaml
# edge-case-tests.yaml
description: "Edge cases and boundary conditions"

tests:
  - description: "Handle incomplete conversation (early termination)"
    vars:
      transcript: "Advisor: Hello, I'm... [call disconnected]"

```python
# Example evaluation script
from typing import List, Dict
import json

def calculate_metrics(eval_results: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    """
    Calculate comprehensive evaluation metrics.
    """

    total_tests = len(eval_results)
    passed_tests = sum(1 for r in eval_results if r['passed'])

    # Core metrics
    accuracy = passed_tests / total_tests

    # By category
    categories = {}
    for result in eval_results:
        category = result.get('category', 'unknown')
        if category not in categories:
            categories[category] = {'total': 0, 'passed': 0}
        categories[category]['total'] += 1
        if result['passed']:
            categories[category]['passed'] += 1

    category_accuracy = {
        cat: stats['passed'] / stats['total']
        for cat, stats in categories.items()
    }

    # Latency metrics
    latencies = [r['latency_ms'] for r in eval_results]
    p50_latency = sorted(latencies)[len(latencies) // 2]
    p95_latency = sorted(latencies)[int(len(latencies) * 0.95)]

    # Token efficiency
    total_tokens = sum(r.get('tokens_used', 0) for r in eval_results)
    avg_tokens = total_tokens / total_tests

    return {
        'overall_accuracy': accuracy,
        'total_tests': total_tests,
        'passed_tests': passed_tests,
        'failed_tests': total_tests - passed_tests,
        'category_accuracy': category_accuracy,
        'latency_p50_ms': p50_latency,
        'latency_p95_ms': p95_latency,
        'avg_tokens_per_test': avg_tokens,
        'total_cost_estimate': (total_tokens / 1_000_000) * 3.00  # $3/MTok for Claude
    }
```

#### 3.5.2 Key Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** % of correct outputs vs. ground truth
- **Precision:** % of extracted facts that are correct
- **Recall:** % of true facts that were extracted
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Hallucination Rate:** % of outputs containing false information
- **Consistency:** % of identical inputs producing identical outputs

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Latency P50/P95:** Response time percentiles
- **Token Efficiency:** Avg tokens used per evaluation
- **Cost Per Evaluation:** Estimated API cost
- **Throughput:** Evaluations per minute

**Robustness Metrics:**
- **Edge Case Coverage:** % of edge cases passed
- **Adversarial Resistance:** % of security tests passed
- **Failure Mode Analysis:** Distribution of failure types

### 3.6 Continuous Improvement Workflow

#### 3.6.1 Prompt Evolution Process

```
1. BASELINE EVALUATION
   ↓
   - Run full evaluation suite on current prompt
   - Establish baseline metrics
   - Identify failure patterns

2. HYPOTHESIS & MODIFICATION
   ↓
   - Analyze failures (manual review + clustering)
   - Formulate improvement hypothesis
   - Create modified prompt variant

3. A/B TESTING
   ↓
   - Run evaluation on both variants
   - Compare metrics across all categories
   - Statistical significance testing

4. REGRESSION CHECK
   ↓
   - Ensure no degradation on golden tests
   - Validate improvement on target category
   - Check for unexpected side effects

5. STAGED ROLLOUT
   ↓
   - 10% traffic (shadow mode comparison)
   - 50% traffic (monitor production metrics)
   - 100% traffic (full deployment)

6. MONITORING & ITERATION
   ↓
   - Track production performance
   - Collect new edge cases
   - Update evaluation dataset
   - Return to step 1
```

#### 3.6.2 Example: Iterative Prompt Refinement

**Iteration 1: Baseline**
```
PROMPT: "Analyze this conversation and extract client goals."

RESULTS:
- Golden tests: 87% accuracy
- Edge cases: 65% accuracy
- Issue: Misses implicit goals
```

**Iteration 2: Add Examples**
```
PROMPT: "Analyze this conversation and extract client goals.

Examples of goals:
- Explicit: 'I want to retire at 65'
- Implicit: 'My daughter starts college in 3 years' → Education funding goal

Extract both explicit and implicit goals from: [transcript]"

RESULTS:
- Golden tests: 92% accuracy ✅ (+5%)
- Edge cases: 78% accuracy ✅ (+13%)
- Issue: Still struggles with conflicting goals
```

**Iteration 3: Add Conflict Handling**
```
PROMPT: "Analyze this conversation and extract client goals.

Instructions:
1. Identify explicit goals (directly stated)
2. Identify implicit goals (inferred from context)
3. Flag conflicting goals (e.g., early retirement + large expenses)

Examples: [...]

Extract goals from: [transcript]"

RESULTS:
- Golden tests: 95% accuracy ✅ (+3%)
- Edge cases: 89% accuracy ✅ (+11%)
- Adversarial: 100% ✅
- DEPLOY
```

### 3.7 Production Monitoring Integration

**LangSmith Production Tracing:**

```python
from langsmith import Client
from langsmith.run_helpers import traceable

client = Client()

@traceable(run_type="chain", name="conversation_analysis")
def analyze_conversation(transcript: str, config: dict):
    """
    Production-instrumented conversation analysis.
    """

    # Execution automatically traced to LangSmith
    result = run_analysis_pipeline(transcript, config)

    # Log custom metadata
    return result

# Automatic dataset creation from production
client.create_dataset_from_runs(
    dataset_name="prod-failures-2024-10",
    run_filter="and(eq(status, 'error'), gte(start_time, '2024-10-01'))"
)
```

**Monitoring Dashboards:**
- **Real-time Metrics:** Latency, error rate, cost
- **Quality Metrics:** User feedback, human review scores
- **Drift Detection:** Output distribution changes over time
- **Error Analysis:** Clustering of failure modes

### 3.8 Recommended Evaluation Stack

**For Wealth Management Conversation Analysis:**

```yaml
# Recommended tooling
evaluation:
  primary: promptfoo  # CLI + CI/CD
  secondary: langsmith  # Production tracing

testing:
  golden_dataset_size: 100-200 conversations
  edge_case_dataset_size: 50-100 scenarios

## 5. Key Takeaways and Recommendations

### 5.1 Critical Success Factors

1. **Dynamic Temperature Adjustment is Essential**
   - Fixed temperature cannot serve diverse conversation analysis needs
   - Stage-specific temperature tuning (facts=low, insights=high, summary=medium)
   - ~50% memory efficiency gain enables scale

2. **Semantic Similarity Rating Outperforms Direct Scoring**
   - 90% test-retest reliability vs. unstable direct LLM ratings
   - Textual reasoning provides actionable coaching feedback
   - Dual perspective (advisor + client) captures full conversation quality

3. **Evaluation-Driven SDLC is Non-Negotiable**
   - Manual testing insufficient for production LLM applications
   - Golden/edge/adversarial test trifecta ensures robustness
   - CI/CD quality gates prevent regression and enable rapid iteration

### 5.2 Recommended Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **LLM:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (balance of quality, speed, cost)
- **Evaluation:** PromptFoo (CI/CD) + LangSmith (production monitoring)
- **Embeddings:** all-mpnet-base-v2 (SSR semantic matching)
- **Infrastructure:** Serverless functions for scale

**Development Workflow:**
1. Hypothesis-driven prompt refinement
2. Local evaluation with PromptFoo
3. PR with automatic evaluation runs
4. Quality gate validation
5. Staged production rollout
6. Continuous monitoring and dataset expansion

### 5.3 Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Insufficient Evaluation Coverage**
- Solution: Maintain 3:1 ratio (tests : prompt variants)

**Pitfall 2: Ignoring Edge Cases**
- Solution: Dedicated edge case dataset, ≥85% pass requirement

**Pitfall 3: Direct LLM Rating Instability**
- Solution: Always use SSR with reference statements

**Pitfall 4: No Regression Tracking**
- Solution: Automated comparison of PR vs. main branch metrics

**Pitfall 5: Fixed Temperature Across Tasks**
- Solution: Stage-specific DTA configuration per conversation phase
