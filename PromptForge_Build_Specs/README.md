# PromptForge SaaS Build Specification

## Overview
This repository defines a **four-phase build plan** for developing **PromptForge**, a SaaS platform for Prompt Management, PromptOps, and AI Risk Governance.  
Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring modularity, enterprise scalability, and compliance-grade governance.

---

## 📘 Phase Summary

| Phase | Title | Key Deliverables | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **1** | [Core UI Build](./Phase1_CoreUI.md) | React micro-frontends, MVC structure, mock APIs, Git integration | None |
| **2** | [Core API & Platform](./Phase2_APIs.md) | FastAPI backend, Postgres + Redis, GitOps, prompt evaluations | Phase 1 |
| **3** | [SaaS Refinement](./Phase3_SaaSRefinement.md) | Multi-tenancy, CLI tools, AI Gateway integration, payments | Phases 1–2 |
| **4** | [Enterprise Enablement](./Phase4_EnterpriseEnablement.md) | SOC2 compliance, RBAC, hybrid deployment, model governance | Phases 1–3 |

## 🧠 Agentic AI Execution Plan

This project is designed for **Agentic AI orchestration**, enabling tools such as **Claude, GPT-Engineer, or OpenDevin** to execute and validate each phase autonomously.

### Execution Order
1. Load and execute `Phase1_CoreUI.md`
2. Validate UI shell + mock API success criteria.
3. Load and execute `Phase2_APIs.md` once Phase 1 passes.
4. Load and execute `Phase3_SaaSRefinement.md` after full integration tests succeed.
5. Finalize deployment via `Phase4_EnterpriseEnablement.md` for SOC2 and on-prem readiness.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack (MVC Aligned)
| Layer | Tech Stack | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Frontend (View)** | React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Webpack Module Federation | Modular micro-frontends and responsive UI |
| **Backend (Controller)** | FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy, Redis | API logic, data orchestration, async pipelines |
| **Database (Model)** | PostgreSQL, Redis Streams/Kafka | Data persistence, eventing, and caching |
| **Testing** | Jest (frontend), Pytest (backend) | Unit, integration, and regression testing |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, Docker Compose | Continuous integration and test automation |
| **Cloud Runtime** | AWS ECS / Fargate / Lambda | Elastic scaling for API workloads |
| **Observability** | Langfuse, OpenTelemetry | Tracing, metrics, runtime evaluations |

---

## 🚦 Validation & Governance Flow
Each phase includes validation criteria ensuring project continuity:

1. **UI Validation:** Verify micro-frontend rendering and mock API wiring.  
2. **API Validation:** Run Postman collections and test suites.  
3. **Multi-Client Validation:** Tenant separation and RBAC enforcement.  
4. **Enterprise Validation:** SOC2 audit checks, compliance logs, and payment integration.  

---

## 💡 Agent Prompt Template (Example)
For each phase, invoke your agent with the following pattern:

```
You are a senior SaaS architect.
Read the specification file: PhaseX_<Title>.md
Execute and validate all tasks sequentially.
Pause after validation. Output progress summary and test results.
If all tests pass, proceed to the next phase.
```
*(Replace `X` with the appropriate phase number.)*

---

## 🧭 Continuity & Sequencing
The phases are designed for **sequential continuity**. Each phase’s outputs (UI modules, API schemas, test reports) are used as inputs for the next phase, ensuring consistent evolution of the platform.

---

## 📈 Future Expansion
- Integration with **PromptForge AI Gateway** for runtime policy enforcement.
- Incorporation of **AIOps & PromptOps** for automated quality evaluation.
- Support for **custom evaluation plugins** (Guardrails, DeepEval, Langfuse).

---

## 🏁 Summary
PromptForge defines a **vendor-neutral**, **developer-friendly**, and **compliance-ready** framework for building and operating AI prompt systems at enterprise scale.

This repository serves as the **blueprint for your Agentic AI development journey** — from prototype to production-grade SaaS.
