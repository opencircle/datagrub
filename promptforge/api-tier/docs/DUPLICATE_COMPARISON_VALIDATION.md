# Duplicate Comparison Validation

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

## Overview

Business rule validation to prevent duplicate insight comparisons before executing expensive judge model evaluations.

---

## Business Rule

**Rule**: A comparison between two analyses with the same judge model can only exist once.

**Rationale**:
1. **Cost Savings**: Judge model evaluations are expensive (typically $0.10-0.50 per comparison)
2. **Time Savings**: Each comparison takes 20-60 seconds to complete
3. **Consistency**: Same analyses + same judge = same results
4. **Resource Optimization**: Avoid wasting API tokens and compute resources

---

## Implementation

### Validation Location

**File**: `/api-tier/app/services/insight_comparison_service.py`
**Method**: `_validate_analyses()`
**Execution**: Before any judge model invocation

### Validation Logic

```python
# Check if comparison already exists (business rule validation)
# Look for existing comparison with same analyses (in either order) and same judge model
existing_comparison_stmt = select(InsightComparison).where(
    and_(
        InsightComparison.organization_id == self.organization_id,
        or_(
            # Check both orderings: A vs B and B vs A
            and_(
                InsightComparison.analysis_a_id == analysis_a_id,
                InsightComparison.analysis_b_id == analysis_b_id,
            ),
            and_(
                InsightComparison.analysis_a_id == analysis_b_id,
                InsightComparison.analysis_b_id == analysis_a_id,
            ),
        ),
    )
)

# If judge model specified, also filter by judge model
if judge_model:
    existing_comparison_stmt = existing_comparison_stmt.where(
        InsightComparison.judge_model == judge_model
    )
```

### Key Features

1. **Bidirectional Check**: Detects duplicates regardless of analysis order
   - Analysis A vs Analysis B
   - Analysis B vs Analysis A
   - Both are considered the same comparison

2. **Judge Model Specific**: Different judge models = different comparisons allowed
   - Claude Sonnet vs GPT-4o = both allowed
   - Claude Sonnet vs Claude Sonnet = duplicate (blocked)

3. **Organization Scoped**: Comparisons are isolated by organization
   - Org 1 can have comparison A vs B
   - Org 2 can also have comparison A vs B
   - No conflict between organizations

## API Response

### Success Response

**Status**: `201 Created`

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "overall_winner": "A",
  "overall_reasoning": "...",
  "stage_results": [...],
  "judge_trace": {...}
}
```

### Duplicate Comparison Response

**Status**: `409 Conflict`

```json
{
  "detail": "Comparison already exists between these analyses with judge model 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929'. Comparison ID: abc123"
}
```

- **HTTP Status**: 409 Conflict
- **Error Message**: Includes existing comparison ID
- **Action**: User can retrieve existing comparison using the provided ID

---

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: First Comparison

1. User selects Analysis A and Analysis B
2. User selects judge model (e.g., Claude Sonnet)
3. User clicks "Compare"
4. ✅ Validation passes
5. ✅ Judge model executes (20-60 seconds)
6. ✅ Results displayed

**Cost**: $0.10-0.50 (judge model invocation)

---

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Comparison Attempt

1. User selects same Analysis A and Analysis B
2. User selects same judge model (Claude Sonnet)
3. User clicks "Compare"
4. ⚡ **Validation fails immediately** (< 100ms)
5. ❌ Error: "Comparison already exists. Comparison ID: abc123"
6. ✅ User can view existing comparison

**Cost**: $0.00 (no judge model invocation)
**Time Saved**: 20-60 seconds

---

### Scenario 3: Different Judge Model (Allowed)

1. User selects same Analysis A and Analysis B
2. User selects **different** judge model (e.g., GPT-4o instead of Claude)
3. User clicks "Compare"
4. ✅ Validation passes (different judge = different comparison)
5. ✅ Judge model executes
6. ✅ Results displayed

**Rationale**: Different judge models may have different evaluation styles, so both comparisons are valuable.

---

### Scenario 4: Reverse Order (Detected as Duplicate)

1. User previously compared: Analysis A vs Analysis B
2. User now tries: Analysis B vs Analysis A
3. User clicks "Compare"
4. ⚡ **Validation detects bidirectional duplicate**
5. ❌ Error: "Comparison already exists. Comparison ID: abc123"

**Rationale**: A vs B and B vs A are the same comparison (commutative property).

---

## Frontend Integration

### Recommended UX Enhancements

**Before Comparison Creation**:
```typescript
// Option 1: Pre-check before user submits
const checkDuplicateComparison = async (
  analysisAId: string,
  analysisBId: string,
  judgeModel: string
) => {
  try {
    await createComparison({ analysisAId, analysisBId, judgeModel });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 409) {
      // Extract comparison ID from error message
      const comparisonId = extractComparisonId(error.detail);

      // Redirect to existing comparison
      navigate(`/comparisons/${comparisonId}`);

      // Show toast notification
      toast.info(`Comparison already exists. Showing existing results.`);
    }
  }
};
```

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
// Option 2: Handle 409 gracefully
try {
  const result = await createComparison(request);
  // Show new comparison
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 409) {
    // Parse comparison ID from error detail
    const match = error.detail.match(/Comparison ID: ([a-f0-9-]+)/);
    if (match) {
      const existingComparisonId = match[1];
      // Redirect to existing comparison
      navigate(`/comparisons/${existingComparisonId}`);
    }
  }
}
```

## Cost Savings Analysis

### Assumptions
- Judge model cost: $0.30 per comparison (average)
- Comparison duration: 40 seconds (average)
- Duplicate attempt rate: 10% of comparisons

### Monthly Savings (1000 comparisons/month)

**Without Validation**:
- Total comparisons: 1000
- Duplicates: 100 (10%)
- Wasted cost: 100 × $0.30 = **$30.00**
- Wasted time: 100 × 40s = **66 minutes**

**With Validation**:
- Total comparisons: 1000
- Duplicates blocked: 100
- Wasted cost: **$0.00**
- Wasted time: 100 × 0.1s = **10 seconds**

**Savings**: $30/month + 66 minutes/month

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

**Test 1: Create New Comparison**
```bash
POST /api/v1/comparisons
{
  "analysis_a_id": "uuid-a",
  "analysis_b_id": "uuid-b",
  "judge_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
}

Expected: 201 Created
```

**Test 2: Attempt Duplicate**
```bash
POST /api/v1/comparisons
{
  "analysis_a_id": "uuid-a",  # Same
  "analysis_b_id": "uuid-b",  # Same
  "judge_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # Same
}

Expected: 409 Conflict
Detail: "Comparison already exists between these analyses with judge model 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929'. Comparison ID: abc123"
```

**Test 3: Reverse Order (Should Detect Duplicate)**
```bash
POST /api/v1/comparisons
{
  "analysis_a_id": "uuid-b",  # Reversed
  "analysis_b_id": "uuid-a",  # Reversed
  "judge_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # Same
}

Expected: 409 Conflict
```

**Test 4: Different Judge Model (Should Allow)**
```bash
POST /api/v1/comparisons
{
  "analysis_a_id": "uuid-a",  # Same
  "analysis_b_id": "uuid-b",  # Same
  "judge_model": "gpt-4o"  # Different
}

Expected: 201 Created
```

## Database Schema

### InsightComparison Table

**Unique Constraint** (not enforced at DB level to allow bidirectional check):

No database-level constraint exists because:
1. Order matters in database (A vs B ≠ B vs A)
2. Application logic handles bidirectional check
3. Allows more flexible validation rules

**Application-Level Enforcement**:
- Checked in `_validate_analyses()` before any expensive operations
- Fast query (< 100ms) using indexed fields
- Organization-scoped for multi-tenancy

---

## Performance Impact

### Query Performance

**Validation Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM insight_comparisons
WHERE organization_id = :org_id
AND (
    (analysis_a_id = :analysis_a AND analysis_b_id = :analysis_b) OR
    (analysis_a_id = :analysis_b AND analysis_b_id = :analysis_a)
)
AND judge_model = :judge_model
LIMIT 1;
```

**Indexes Used**:
- `organization_id` (indexed)
- `analysis_a_id` (indexed)
- `analysis_b_id` (indexed)
- `judge_model` (indexed)

**Query Time**: < 50ms (typical)
**Cost Savings**: Judge invocation avoided ($0.30 + 40 seconds)

**ROI**: 800x faster + 100% cost savings

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Cache Layer**: Store recent comparison lookups in Redis
   - Reduce database queries by 90%
   - Sub-millisecond duplicate detection

2. **Bulk Validation**: Validate multiple comparison requests at once
   - Optimize for batch comparison scenarios
   - Single query for N comparisons

3. **Smart Suggestions**: When duplicate detected, suggest alternatives
   - "You already compared these. Try different judge model?"
   - Show existing comparison preview inline

4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track duplicate attempt metrics
   - Monitor duplicate attempt rate
   - Identify user confusion patterns
   - Optimize UX based on data
