## Key Improvements

### 1. Executive Summary with Clear Structure

**Before:**
```
Model B demonstrated significantly superior performance across the two most critical stages,
winning decisively in Stage 2 (Insights) and Stage 3 (Summary), while Model A only won
Stage 1 (Fact Extraction). **Quality Analysis by Stage:** - Stage 1 (30% weight): Model A...
[Dense 300+ word paragraph continues]
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Executive Summary

### Overall Verdict
**Model B outperforms by 19.4% overall** with consistent, reliable performance.

### Key Findings
- **Quality Improvement:** +19.4% average score improvement
- **Cost Impact:** +$0.00001 (+0.8%) — negligible cost difference
- **Risk Assessment:** Model A shows critical failure in Stage 2
- **Business Impact:** Model B eliminates hallucination risk

### Primary Deciding Factor
Model A's severe failure in Stage 2 (Insights) with groundedness scores of 0.45...

### Temperature Analysis
[Stage-wise temperature settings and recommendations]

### Final Recommendation
✅ **Use Model B exclusively** for production workloads

**Rationale:**
- Superior quality (+19.4%) with negligible cost increase
- Eliminates critical hallucination risk
- Consistent performance across all stages
- Optimal temperature configuration
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Scannable bullet points instead of dense prose
- ✅ Clear section headings for quick navigation
- ✅ Visual indicators (✅/❌/⚠️) for at-a-glance understanding
- ✅ Structured rationale for decision-making

### 2. Temperature Analysis Section

**New Feature:**
Comprehensive temperature analysis with stage-wise settings and recommendations.

**Temperature Analysis Output:**
```markdown
### Temperature Analysis

**Model A Temperature Settings:**
- Stage 1: 0.3
- Stage 2: 0.5
- Stage 3: 0.2

**Model B Temperature Settings:**
- Stage 1: 0.0
- Stage 2: 0.3
- Stage 3: 0.0

**Temperature Impact:**
- **Fact Extraction (Stage 1):** Lower temperatures (0.0-0.3) recommended
- **Insight Generation (Stage 2):** Moderate temperatures (0.3-0.5) balance creativity
- **Summarization (Stage 3):** Lower temperatures (0.0-0.3) ensure accuracy
- **Recommendation:** Use temperature ≤ 0.3 for all stages to minimize hallucination risk
```

**Temperature Recommendations:**

| Stage | Purpose | Optimal Range | Rationale |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Stage 1 | Fact Extraction | 0.0 - 0.3 | Deterministic extraction minimizes hallucination |
| Stage 2 | Insight Generation | 0.3 - 0.5 | Balances creativity with groundedness |
| Stage 3 | Summarization | 0.0 - 0.3 | Ensures consistent, accurate summaries |

**Production Guidelines:**
- High reliability use cases: temperature ≤ 0.3 across all stages
- Exploratory analysis: up to 0.5 for Stage 2 only
- Never exceed 0.5 in production environments
- If groundedness < 0.70, reduce temperature by 0.1

### 3. Enhanced Stage-Wise Comparisons

**Before:**
```
Response B demonstrated superior fact extraction with higher groundedness (0.92 vs 0.85)
and completeness (0.88 vs 0.75). Specifically, Response B captured all key customer pain
points mentioned in lines 45-67 of the transcript, while Response A missed the critical
pricing concern. Both responses were faithful to the source, but Response B's systematic
approach to organizing facts by topic resulted in better overall accuracy.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Stage 1: Fact Extraction Analysis

**Winner:** Response B

**Key Findings:**
- Response B achieved higher groundedness (0.92 vs 0.85) and completeness (0.88 vs 0.75)
- Response B captured all key customer pain points (lines 45-67)
- Response A missed critical pricing concern mentioned in transcript
- Both responses were faithful to source material
- Response B used systematic topic-based organization

**Critical Observations:**
- Response B's methodical approach resulted in superior accuracy
- Response A's fact extraction gaps could impact downstream analysis
- Completeness difference of 17.3% is significant for business use

**Recommendation:** Response B provides more reliable foundation for subsequent stages
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear winner declaration at the top
- ✅ Bullet points for easy scanning
- ✅ Separate sections for findings, observations, and recommendations
- ✅ Quantified differences highlighted
- ✅ Business impact explicitly stated

## Example Output

### Complete Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

### Overall Verdict
**Model B outperforms by 22.7% overall** with consistent, reliable performance across all stages.

### Key Findings
- **Quality Improvement:** +22.7% average score improvement
- **Cost Impact:** +$0.0001 (+4.8%) — negligible cost difference
- **Risk Assessment:** Model A shows severe hallucination in Stage 2 (Insights)
- **Business Impact:** Model B eliminates hallucination risk and ensures reliable insights

### Primary Deciding Factor
Model A's severe failure in Stage 2 (Insights) with groundedness scores of 0.45 and accuracy of 0.40 indicates hallucination and unreliable insights — a critical failure mode for business decision-making. Model B eliminates this risk while delivering superior results in all stages.

### Temperature Analysis
**Model A Temperature Settings:**
- Stage 1: 0.3
- Stage 2: 0.7
- Stage 3: 0.5

**Model B Temperature Settings:**
- Stage 1: 0.0
- Stage 2: 0.3
- Stage 3: 0.0

**Temperature Impact:**
- **Fact Extraction (Stage 1):** Lower temperatures (0.0-0.3) recommended for deterministic fact extraction
- **Insight Generation (Stage 2):** Moderate temperatures (0.3-0.5) balance creativity with groundedness
- **Summarization (Stage 3):** Lower temperatures (0.0-0.3) ensure consistent, accurate summaries
- **Recommendation:** Use temperature ≤ 0.3 for all stages to minimize hallucination risk
- **Analysis:** Model A's high temperature (0.7) in Stage 2 likely caused hallucination issues

### Final Recommendation
✅ **Use Model B exclusively** for production workloads

**Rationale:**
- Superior quality (+22.7%) with negligible cost increase
- Eliminates critical hallucination risk observed in Model A
- Consistent performance across all pipeline stages
- Optimal temperature configuration (≤0.3) ensures reliable outputs
```

- Old comparisons with paragraph format will still display correctly
- New comparisons automatically use the enhanced format
- Frontend gracefully handles both formats

### Database Impact
None. No schema changes required.
