Design consistency is exemplary (97% score). Accessibility achieves AA standard with 3 minor warnings preventing AAA certification. No regressions detected.

The attention to detail in applying design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, focus states) is commendable. The UX improvements (direct edit/delete icons, prominent search, reduced whitespace) significantly enhance usability. The main limitation is the absence of automated tests - this should be addressed before scaling to production. The accessibility warnings are minor and can be resolved in a follow-up iteration without blocking current release.",
